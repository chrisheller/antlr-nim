# antlr-nim
Nim ANTLR binding. 

The idea is to use the existing ANTLR 3 C bindings for this, although the ANTLR 4 C++ bindings 
may work as well.  The main reason for preferring the ANTLR 3 C bindings is that I have already
been working with those for some projects that use ANTLR 3, but porting those to ANTLR 4 isn't
out of the question. 

This has been in "list of things to do when I have spare time" for awhile, but creating the 
repository is at least a step in the right direction :)
